  "summary": "Diff adds a reusable ShareButton component that copies window.location.href to the clipboard and shows updated Valentine-specific toast copy. ValentineProposalScreen is updated to render ShareButton in the success (\"Good Choice\") view, but the provided truncated diff does not show the proposal (\"Will You Be My Valentine?\") view rendering a Share button, so REQ-30 cannot be confirmed from available evidence. Diff also appears to adjust \"No\" button interaction handling for touch/hover, which was not requested in this BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Render a visible, tap-friendly \"Share\" button on the Valentine proposal screen (\"Will You Be My Valentine?\" view) that copies the current page URL to the clipboard and shows a confirmation toast.",
      "reason": "The truncated ValentineProposalScreen.tsx diff does not include the section of the proposal view where the buttons are rendered, so there is no explicit evidence that <ShareButton /> is rendered on the \"Will You Be My Valentine?\" screen.",
